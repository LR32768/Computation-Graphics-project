# Computation-Graphics-project

This is LR's computational graphic final homework project.
it will update irregularly due to LR's strange habit.

current stage:

**1.** Define vector and ray object with basic computation operator in maths.h

**2.** Define sphere object and its intersect algorithm in objects.h

**3.** Define bounding box object in utils.h
